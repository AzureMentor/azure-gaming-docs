# Leaderboard Reference Architecture

This reference architecture describes a leaderboard use case and implementation with different alternatives, enabling you to architect your own cloud solution so you can have full control and customization to fit your game design like a glove.

> [!TIP]
> If you are looking for an out-of-the-box leaderboard solution, **PlayFab** is a complete back-end platform for building, launching, and growing cloud connected games that has [leaderboard support](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/features/social/tournaments-leaderboards/).

## Leaderboard design

There are many variables which can be taken into consideration when defining a leaderboard. Here are some examples for you to consider:

- **Geography**: Physical location where the player is located. Be as granular as you want, from countries to regions to continents and beyond. Examples: France, China, USA, North America, Asia, EMEA.
- **Platform**: Device or service the game is played on. You could also consider enabling leaderboards that combine more than one platform. Examples: Xbox, PlayStation, PC, iOS, Android, Mobile, Consoles.
- **Mode**: Distinct configuration that varies gameplay and affects how other game mechanics behave. Examples: solo, duo, squad, PvE, PvP, campaign.
- **Difficulty**: The user-selected challenge. Examples: easy, medium, hard.
- **Option**: Individual options the player has chosen. Examples: character (human, vehicle), item (weapon, tool), setting (manual or automatic shifting).
- **Level**: In-game level or stage. Examples: Level 2-1, Track 3.
- **Statistic**: Individual value that the player generates based on usage or actions. Examples: score, wins, losses, coins collected.

### Player authentication and identity

This reference architecture doesn't cover neither player authentication nor player identity, both are left as an exercise for the reader.

PlayFab offers multiple [forms of authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/#pivot=documentation&panel=authentication) so players can be tracked across multiple devices:

- Device ID for guest login
- Username/password
- Google account
- GameCenter account
- Facebook account
- Steam account
- Kongregate account
- Twitch account
- Other oAuth providers
- Android device ID
- Custom player ID

### Size and complexity

Leaderboards can vary from a very simple system of ranking players based on a score, or it can grow in size and complexity by tracking a combination of multiple statistics, options, levels, platforms, and more. For example, imagine a leaderboard combining the variables **Platform**, **Geography**, **Mode**, **level** and **Statistic**.  This would allow ranking of players in a game scenario using values like "score (Stat) of players using an *Xbox One* (Platform) in *France* (Geography) for the mode *Player vs Player* (mode) on level *3* (level)". With this data being tracked, you could then remove the Geography filter and rank all players regardless of where they live.

In another example, imagine combining the variables **System**, **Level** and **Statistic**. This would allow the game to rank players in a racing game scenario like "time to complete the track *NÃ¼rburgring* (level) by players competing on *PC* (system).

Of course, specific games might have even more ways to rank players against each other. The documented sample implementations are a starting point using just a few of the variables above. In this use case the **player's score will be ranked based on two variables: platform and level**. Players from each platform will compete for the highest score on each level. Feel free to build from here and modify to suit your game's needs.

### Data refreshing

A leaderboard with stale data is almost as bad as not having a leaderboard. However, for cost reasons, it may make sense to avoid refreshing data frequently. Try to space out the refreshes and recalculate the rankings in a range from every minute up to every hour. In some cases it may even make sense even to refresh once per day.

If you really need to have the leaderboard data refreshed in (near) real-time, this reference architecture on either implementation will accommodate.

### Players around me

It is a best practice to show where the user is located on the leaderboard, so the player can see who is above and below them, and show that they can climb higher, while not demoralizing the player by showing them the top-ranked players they have a long way to go to beat.

### Anti-cheating

It's inevitable that some players will try to inject bogus scores into your leaderboards, that will have a negative impact on the community. There are a few things that you can do to try to make things difficult for the cheaters:

- Encrypt the communications between the client and the cloud to prevent packet sniffing.
- Add telemetry and then use it on the server side to see if a score makes sense, ideally automatically so cheated scores can be detected on the fly. Two straight forward checks would be:
    1. Could the player finish a level that fast?
    2. How often can a player submit a score? AKA the rate of incoming high scores.
- Do not discard scores that are incorrect. Instead mark both the score and the player (careful focusing on IPs as they may accidentally impact legit users) that submitted the score as a cheater. After that, in one hand when legit users are accessing the leaderboards, retrieve only the non-cheating scores. On the other hand, in the case of cheaters, retrieve only the incorrect scores. The idea is to avoid giving the cheater direct feedback that the bogus score injection didn't work so they stop as they feel the mission was accomplished.

## Reference implementation details

When it comes to choosing the database that will store the records achieved by your players for being ranked in a pertinent leaderboard, one of the first decisions to make is choosing between a relational or non-relational data structure. There are certain differences to bear in mind:

||Relational|Non-relational|
|----------|----------|-----------|
|**Preparative**|Structure of the data must be determined beforehand, changes later can be disruptive|Minimum|
|**Rigidness**|All the data must follow the same structure|Each data entry can have its own structure and new fields can be easily added later on|
|**Primary storage model**|Table based|Document store, graph database, key-value store or wide column store|
|**Scalability**|Vertically scalable - increase server CPU, RAM or storage|Horizontally scalable - sharding or add more servers|

For all the details on the different storage models see [choose the right data store](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/data-store-overview).

On a final note, personal expertise on either alternative is something to take into consideration. Choosing the known path will spare you from having to deal with an entirely new set of unknown problems and also have to become proficient on new best practices and concepts.

Here are two different implementations of the same simple and advanced leaderboard use cases to get you a head start:

- [Non-relational](./leaderboard-non-relational.md): using Azure Cache for Redis for small scale or Azure Cosmos DB for large scale.
- [Relational](./leaderboard-relational.md): using Azure SQL Database or MySQL for small scale or Azure SQL Database for large scale.
