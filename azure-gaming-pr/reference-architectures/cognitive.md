# Cognitive Services Reference Architectures

## Use cases

Cognitive Services can be used to improve a variety of gaming scenarios, both in- and out-of-game.  Here are a few ideas to consider as you are building your game:

* [Content Moderation](./cognitive-content-moderation.md)
  * Moderate your in-game chat and other user-created data to ensure a safe and healthy environment.
* [Text Translation](./cognitive-text-translation.md)
  * Translate text between languages so players across the world can communicate with each other in their native language.
* [Text to Speech](./cognitive-text-to-speech.md)
  * Help being everyone into the conversation by translating text to audio.
* [Customer Service Bot](./cognitive-css-bot.md)
  * Let players get help with multiple areas of the game, such as hints, supports, and release information, from a chat bot that can be hosted on multiple channels.
